              <h4>English National Opera singers are helping 'long COVID' patients breathe</h4>
              <p>The English National Opera (ENO) is rolling out its singing, breathing and wellbeing program for recovering coronavirus patients around the country following a successful trial.

                ENO Breathe is a joint project between the ENO and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, combining musical and medical expertise to help COVID-19 patients suffering with long-term symptoms, according to a press release published Thursday.
                
                Some coronavirus patients are back to normal health within weeks. But for others, issues persist for months or cause damage that might lead to other health issues in the future.</p>

              <h4>Star Wars' series fires Gina Carano after Holocaust post</h4>
              <p>Carano has not responded after the award-winning show cut her off

                The production company behind the science fiction series "The Mandalorian" has fired its lead actress, Gina Carano, citing her social media posts. 
                
                The Walt Disney co-owned movie studio, Lucasfilm, said on Thursday that Carano was no longer affiliated with the company and would not be in the future. The former mixed marital arts (MMA) fighter was playing the recurring character Cara Dune in "The Mandolorian", which is set in the "Star Wars" universe.
                
                Earlier this week, Carano shared a post on Instagram comparing the treatment of people with different political affiliations in the United States to the beginning of the Holocaust.
                
                In the post, she said the Nazi government was able to persecute Jews by making "their own neighbors hate them simply for being Jews." "How is that any different from hating someone for their political views?" the post read. .</p>
